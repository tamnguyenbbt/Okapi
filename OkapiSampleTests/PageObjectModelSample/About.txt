This is a finished simple test structure using Page Object Model as the form of web object repository
- Each web page is represented as a Page Object Model (POM) class
- Seperate the concerns: Data Transfer Objects (DTOs), Data, POMs, test steps, and test cases
	--> Easier to share works, build and maintain
	--> Maximize code reusability
- This sample automates the tests for Facebook SignUp page

Steps to automate:
1. Create DTOs
2. Create Test Data for various test scenario
3. Build POMs
4. Build data-driven reusable steps, decorating them so they are reportable
5. Build test cases, decorating them so they are reportable
6. Run tests
